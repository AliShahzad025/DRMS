# DRMS
DRRMS is a centralized system for managing disaster relief resources. It tracks food, water, medicine, volunteers, and SOS requests in real time. It prioritizes urgent cases, assigns tasks, sends alerts, and generates reports to improve coordination, reduce delays, and ensure fair, transparent aid distribution.
